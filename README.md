Capstone Project Module 3, Study case : Bike Sharing by Siti Hanifah Sadiah

### **Context**

Bike-sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process, from membership, rental, and return back, has become automatic. Through these systems, a user can easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. **Today, great interest exists in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental, and health issues.**

Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike-sharing systems, **the characteristics of data generated by these systems make them attractive for research.** Unlike other transport services such as buses or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns the bike-sharing system into a virtual sensor
network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that the most important events in the city could be detected by monitoring these data.

**Capital Bikeshare** (also abbreviated CaBi) is a bicycle-sharing system which serves Washington, D.C., and certain counties of the larger metropolitan area. As of January 2023, it had 700+ stations and more than 5400 bicycles. The member jurisdictions own most of the equipment and have sourced operations to contractor Motivate International. Opened in September 2010, the system is the third largest bike sharing service in the United States.

The Capital Bikeshare system is owned by the Local governments of the areas served (seven participating jurisdictions: Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia (Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax County, Falls Church), Maryland (Montgomery County, Prince George's County)) and is operated by **Motivate International, Inc.** (formerly Alta Bicycle Share). Motivate is based in Brooklyn, New York and operates Citi Bike in New York City, Bluebikes in Boston, FordGoBike in San Francisco, and Divvy Bikes in Chicago.

Capital Bikeshare is designed to get riders from point A to point B, similar to a bus or a train. Riders can choose short-term access (24-Hour Pass) or long-term access (30-Day Membership or Annual Membership). Riders take a bike from any station, ride to their destination and return it to any available station.

Capital Bikeshare is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year. All trips under 45 minutes on classic bikes are included for members. Members unlock bikes for free and pay the discounted rate of $0.10 per minute for ebikes. For members who ride longer than 45 minutes, a $0.05 per minute rate will apply. Casual riders do not have included minutes on classic rides and pay $1 to unlock and $0.05 per minute for classic bike rides and $0.15 per minute for ebikes.

Capital Bikeshare **Vision** : “Life connected by pedal strokes.”

Capital Bikeshare **Mission** : “To transform our community by providing a high quality, convenient and affordable bicycle transit system that will connect people to more places where they live, work and play in the region.”

In order to achieve its vision and mission, Capital Bikeshare is expected to be able to provide bicycles according to the number of user requests. Determining the number of bicycles that must be provided by Capital Bikeshare needs to be carefully calculated so that there are no shortages or excesses. If there is a shortage of bicycles, Capital Bikeshare can be considered a failure in achieveing its vision and mission. Meanwhile, if there is an excess number of bicycles, the utility of bicycles will be low and have a negative impact on operational management carried out by Motivate International, Inc. such as the low level of Return on Investment (ROI) that has been given by Local governments to buy assets in the form of bicycles.
